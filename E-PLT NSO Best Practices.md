# NSO Best Practices when using EPLT w Sanctioned Games
_July 2023 vers 1.0_

(these are in addition to any NSO best practices that have been established over the years)

## HNSO
* Set CRG to Full Name for File names in Scoreboard Settings:

![](https://github.com/spikenheimer/DerbyWriting/blob/main/SettingsFullName.png)
	* _NOTE: This will only make the file names have the Full Name if no JSON or XLSX files have been created yet.  Once filenames have been created this setting is ignored and whatever prior pattern was used will continue for that game. (those files will require manual renaming)_
* Pre-Prepare games
	* That's it.  Pre prepare them - with the charter docs and those charter skaters entered in teams, the uniform colors etc…
	* Set League Name and Team name as what is in the charter / sanctioning doc or … you’ll be re-submitting things to IGRF@ and stats@ - and if you’ve set Full Name for files as above your statsbook files will reflect the newly recommended  "STATS-YYYY-MM-DD_HostLeagueTeamName_vs_VisitorLeagueTeamName" 
* Teams Roster entry
	* You can copy / paste columnar data from a spreadsheet into the teams entry tabs as long as the columns are formatted in the same ordering that CRG has (since V4) (v2023.0 now also adds a Pronoun column and if you want to keep it blank you need to also copy paste a blank 3rd column)
* Charter vs Roster (aka 20 -> 15 strike outs or cross offs)
	* Use the game edit team edit to mark a skater as Not Skating - this will prevent them from accidentally being added to a Lineup during game by the EPLT
	* This is best executed as a strike through on the pre-printed IGRF charter list (remember to strike both Number and Name) and then electronically editing the team prior to game start
	* Number check is probably too late for this but should also make sure those skaters are not skating 
* IGRF
	* Make a note (your phone or somewhere you’ll have it later) of which of your PLTs are assigned to which team since CRG does not currently have a way for the EPLT NSO to notate who is assigned to which team (and there’s no paperwork for you to look to see who’s done which team)
	* Currently CRG versions  v5.0.11 and v2023.0 do not display information necessary for the IGRF page 1 - specifically penalty counts for each period. 
		* Score Counts (pull from simulated scorekeeping sheets, or from actual SK paperwork)
			* (you can acquire the score totals easily from the sheets tab of either the Sheets tab from the Games (Edit) or if the game is still current on the SBO page  Sheets tab) 
				* _SBO view (*if current game*)_

				* _Game Edit view (*if not current game*)_
					* ![](https://github.com/spikenheimer/DerbyWriting/blob/main/game%20edit.png)
		* For the Penalty Counts - best practice is to think of this ahead of time and note the total counts of penalties at halftime and / or use the counts from the Penalty Box Paperwork.
		* At halftime go into the IGRF tab and hit the Update to save current data. 
	* CRG Version 2023.1 will show penalty counts / scores by period as well as expulsions on the IGRF tab (found in either running game SBO / IGRF or in Games Edit view

* Statsbook
	* Officials Entry
		* If you configure your spreadsheet columns with Position / Name / League and use the same Position Names (including appropriate Casing of letters) you can copy /paste positions 
	* V2023.0 does allow for more entry/ corrections of finished games in the Games editor by clicking on the displayed sheet as appropriate
	* If you have issue exporting a statsbook make sure you have a blank statsbook in the same directory  / folder as the COPYING files (aka the main base directory of CRG) 
	* All in all its probably easiest to do the data entry in CRG for things like officials names etc and then exporting the game to Statsbook and then doing Statsbook editing in Excel / Google sheets like the old days

## PLT
* Use game edit / team edit for number check to ensure that skaters struck from charter for the game roster are listed as Not Skating (if you’re doing Number checks using your EPLT device)
* Editing of penalties etc is capable by touching the Penalty Tracking or Lineup Tracking sections and making changes
* When marking Star Pass’s only the team passing should be tapped in the SP column. The other team will update on its own. 
* Before the game in the NSO meeting the EPLT and SBO should have a talk about who will be marking Star Pass’s so that they are not canceling each other out.  
* When skaters get a penalty it should be marked in the Penalty Tracking area.
* When the penalty is recorded it turns the box button blue, after they sit press it and it turns red. After they have left the box hit the box again to clear. If the skater sits between jams hit the “go to next jam button” before hitting the box button. 
* Substitution for Foul out is possible via touching in the Lineup Tracking area
* Substitution for Expulsion is possible via touching in Lineup Tracking area
* Expulsion is entered on the FO_Ex column 
* The far right column on the Penalty Tracking portion of the screen shows totals (each line is total penalty count for that skater, the top right corner shows total for the team next to the ∑ character

## SBO
* Don't Panic
