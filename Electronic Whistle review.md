# Electronic Whistle review
### April 17, 2021

Given the likelihood that when we return to any sort of derby practices in person we’ll still be wearing masks, I decided to splurge and buy a slew of electronic whistles to evaluate. To that end, I purchased the following electronic whistles from Amazon:
* Fox 40 Electronic Whistle
* Fox 40 Mini Electronic Whistle
* ZHT Electronic Whistle
* Airpirich Electronic Whistle

I had high hopes for the e-whistles from Fox 40 since the de facto standard in derby whistles is the Fox 40 Classic. So let’s cut to the chase right now. Both Fox 40 e-whistles suck. Sad but true.   When I look at e-whistles I focused on the following factors:
- Cost
- Decibel output *
- Battery *
- Usability

When I first opened the shipping box, I realized 2 things:
- *I forgot to buy batteries for these!!!*

- *Why are there 3 of the same boxes in here?!?*

It turned out my concerns were unnecessary - all these e-whistles came with initial batteries.  

## E-Whistle General Thoughts
If you’re used to using a lung operated whistle, one of the first set of adjustments will be ergonomics. All these e-Whistles are going to require adjustments to your muscle memory. First off, they’re larger. Second, they’re heavier. Third, they all pretty much operate with a thumb oriented push button and then emit out the non lanyard end… which for me meant I was constantly worried about muscle memory causing me to deafen myself by triggering an e-whistle blast to my face. All but the Fox 40 Mini have 3 adjustable tone settings. Biggest fail for this review? I had no good place or way to measure whistle volume/loudness. Nor did I take the time to analyze battery life short of user reviews. Most of the e-whistles seem to have the same whistle sample/sound chip - the three sounds are essentially variations on the 3 tone pea-less whistle. The sounds are best described as:
1. typical 3 tone whistle (think Fox 40 Classic)
2. super fast warble (Fox 40 but higher pitch)
3. slower warble (more like a pea whistle)

I’ve heard some concerns about being able to still do various derby whistle actions. Given the nature of the push to activate spring loaded whistle action button on all of these e-whistles, being able to get sharp staccato bursts for say Lead Jammer or Jam Call-Off should be non-issues. Each of these e-whistles will sound for as long as you hold the button down. It’s very much like you’re smashing the X button on your game controller. The one thing you cannot do is swoop, so the End of Period *TWEET TWEET TWEET TWEEEEeeeeeEEEET* just isn’t possible with e-whistles.

## Fox 40 Electronic Whistle - 100 db - $20
Given the general fondness for Fox 40 regular pea-less whistles as well as the cost (Fox 40 e-whistles are at the top of the price list), I had high expectations for this whistle. Sadly, this whistle did not meet my expectations. First off, the packaging has a bunch of plastic - cardboard backing w/ blister pack plastic. Form factor is more akin to a small handheld flashlight. The whistle has grippy rubberized surfaces - a nice feature since most of the plastic that e-whistles use is a matte slippery surface. Inserting the included battery turned into a test of patience and finesse - the sliding locking tab is poorly designed and in the process of opening the battery door you’re likely to break the tab. Not to worry as the door is next to impossible to remove (although I’m sure if it falls to the ground it’s gonna fly open pretty easily….) Sound-wise, I had harbored hopes of digitally sampled Fox 40 Classic sounds but alas, the Fox 40 has similar tones as the other e-whistles.  
###

### Pros
* Replaceable 9V battery
* Selectable sounds
* Grippy surface

### Cons
* Cost
* Battery compartment is impossible to open
* Plastic packaging
* No LED

## Fox 40 Mini Electronic Whistle - 110 db - $18.45
Packaging fail! It’s all plastic blister packaging (fails for sustainability as well as difficulty in opening.) Form factor is closer to a penlight. There is an optional LED light with its own switch. Unlike its larger e-whistle sibling, the battery compartment is designed well but does not have a locking tab. While the optional LED is nice, it feels like a design afterthought - the LED is on the opposite end of the whistle barrel from sound output, and the switch is in no way tied to whistle activation. The mini only has one tone - granted it is the one that sounds like the typical Fox 40 Classic whistle.  
###

### Pros
* Replaceable 4x L1154F watch batteries
* Penlight form factor
* Pocket clip

### Cons
* Cost
* No off switch
* Single sound
* Unsecured battery compartment
* Plastic packaging

## Obuyo/ZHT/Airpirich Electronic Whistle — 120-150 db $12.49 - 14.99
When I searched for e-whistles online, I was surprised at the selection…then I found out that many of the branded e-whistles were all the same with the name “obuyo” screened on all of them. Packaging is all recyclable cardboard and it comes with a carry pouch and USB cable for recharging. The battery compartment is designed well: there is a nice springy locking latch to access. Ironically, you don’t need to access this as the battery it comes with is a rechargeable 2000mAh lithium ion battery.  
###

### Pros
* USB rechargeable 2000mAh rechargeable 18650 lithium battery
* 3 volume settings
* 3 tone settings
* LED for signaling with optional activation with whistle
* Loudest claimed decibel output
* Cost
* Recyclable packaging

### Cons
* Slippery plastic housing
* Specialized/Non-standard battery size (can’t just go to convenience store to get spare batteries)
